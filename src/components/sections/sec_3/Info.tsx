      Now for the fun stuff!
      <br />
      <br />
      We’re the slickest spot in G-Town for real good Street Food, everything
      from Terrific Thai from Noi’s Cafe to Authentic Greek Gyros from the Gyro
      King.
      <br />
      <br />
      We don’t forget the classics too... from hand-stretched Neapolitan Pizza-
      shout out PizzaBGoode- to loaded Fries from our in-house fry experts at
      Abandon Chips.
      <br />
      <br />
      Choose from one of our exciting Beers, Cocktails, Soft Drinks or Mocktails
      from our 3 in-house bars and you’re sure to have a night to remember.
      <br />
      <br />
      Did we mention we’re incredibly Kid Friendly? So much so, UNDER 18s GO
      FREE! (i.e. no ticket required- just let us know how many little ones we
      can expect from the drop-down box) *excludes kids events* We also love
      dogs, a lot. Check out @dogyardsocial if you don’t believe us.
      <br />
      <br />

      Watermelon Daiquiri (mocktails available) / Huuuuuuuuge Premium Beer
